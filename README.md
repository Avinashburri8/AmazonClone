GitOps Pipeline with Argo CD and Argo Rollouts
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a GitOps pipeline using Argo CD for continuous deployment and Argo Rollouts for advanced deployment strategies within a Kubernetes environment. The pipeline automates the deployment and management of a simple web application.

Prerequisites
Familiarity with Kubernetes concepts (Pods, Deployments, Services).
Basic understanding of Docker and containerization.
Experience with Git for version control.
Access to a Kubernetes cluster for testing (Minikube, kind, or a cloud provider's Kubernetes service).
Familiarity with Argo CD and Argo Rollouts documentation.

Task 1: Setup and Configuration
1. Create a GitRepository
Create a GitHub repository and host the source code for the web application.
2. Install Argo CD on Your Kubernetes Cluster
Follow the official Argo CD documentation to install and set up Argo CD on the Kubernetes cluster.
3. Install Argo Rollouts
Install the Argo Rollouts controller in the Kubernetes cluster by following the official guide.

Task 2: Creating the GitOps Pipeline
1. Dockerize the Application
Build a Docker image for the web application and push it to a public container registry.
2. Deploy the Application Using Argo CD
Modify the Kubernetes manifests in the repository to use the Docker image.
Configure Argo CD to monitor the repository and automatically deploy changes to the Kubernetes cluster.

Task 3: Implementing a Canary Release with Argo Rollouts
1. Define a Rollout Strategy
Modify the application's deployment to use Argo Rollouts, specifying a canary release strategy in the rollout definition.
2. Trigger a Rollout
Make a change to the application, update the Docker image, push the new version to the registry, and update the rollout definition to use the new image.
3. Monitor the Rollout
Use Argo Rollouts to monitor the deployment of the new version, ensuring the canary release successfully completes.
